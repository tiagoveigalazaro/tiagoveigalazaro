- 👋 Hi, I’m @tiagoveigalazaro, a Portuguese living in Germany. I'm a tinkerer and learner at heart.
- 👀 Besides software development I’m also interested in gaming, sim racing and music. Surf used to be a thing too
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Google Cloud (Coursera) and proper Cloud Native Architecture (already using pseudo- at work - pun intended)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. I'm building up my confidence to start contributing to the projects I use and love
- 📫 You can reach me at tiago@unravelling.io
